  <h2>3D Animated Avatar</h2>
  <p class="description">My 3D Animated Avatar is of a fictional plant that was bioenginered by humans. This plant will only ever bloom in a Northern facing direction. This plant was created to help humans navigate after years of global warming destroying our planet. We knew after a certain point we could not fix it, so we had to give the next human race the chance of survival.</p>

  <h2>3D Immersive Environment</h2>
  <p class="description">My 3D Immersive Environment is dualy inspired by both A Game of Thrones and their Hall of Faces and Planet of the Apes. I wanted to create a immersive environment that gave credit to both man and ape for their dominance as creatures, I also wanted to portray a type of intensity between the two through different affects.</p>
