<p class="portfolio">Hello, my name is Tyler Blakemore I am initially from Southern California but have been in the Bay Area for five years now, studying and completeing my degree in graphic design and my minor photography. I specialize in design and creative direction. I also have a strong passion for photography. I like to think that both design and photography relate to the organization of information. I like to create while using a wide range of different design/photography styles, rules and techniques.</p>
